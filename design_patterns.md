# Balancing abstractions

The rate at which new tools and applications are being developed has increased exponentially in the last few years. We are able to envision, prototype, design and manufacture ideas at an incredibly fast pace. Tools enhance our capabilities, applications create

I can now drop this into my process and not have to worry about this problem anymore.
while is important to have new tools because they augment our capabilites, we shouldn't stop knowing whats happening under the cover
