### Sorta Functional Programming (SFP), aiming for a fusion of paradigms.

## sell the problem
Introducing the FP paradigm into an existing project.

### start strong 

FP is based on producing the desired result by evaluating expressions, built out of functions composed together.
FP focuses on what should be done, rather than on how.
Writing bad code is just as possible with FP as with any other techniques!


our code should be
- Modular: separate independent functions, which are joined together to produce the final results.
- Understandable: cleaner, shorter
- Testable: Functions can be tested on its own
- Extensible:  code is free from side effects, which mean adding new features without interfering with existing ones
- Reusable: functions are reusable by nature


### explain the problem

## Provide a solution


Introducing the FP paradigm into an existing project, written with a more imperative or object oriented mindset, can prove very challenging. You wouldn't like to dissmiss all the existing features 

The leading approach is boils down to evolution, not revolution. 
 
The guiding idea is evolution, not revolution. you would like to end with code that is easier to reason about and test.


Some background in Computer Science (including, for example, data structures) and good programming practices will also come in handy.
